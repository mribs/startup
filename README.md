## Roomate Grocery List

At least once in every roommate's life they'll notice that they have a lot of the same groceries. This app gives you and your roomates a place to make a collaborative list. You (and anyone you invite) can work on it throughout the week, then when you finish you can use it to show how to evenly divide the cost of your groceries.
