## Roomate Grocery List

At least once in every roommate's life they'll notice that they have a lot of the same groceries. This app gives you and your roomates a place to make a collaborative list. You (and anyone you invite) can work on it throughout the week, then when you finish you can use it to show how to evenly divide the cost of your groceries.

### Other Stuff

Pressing the escape key works wonders when  you accidentally get somewhere you don't want to be *thumbs up*

Don't forget to make your .sh files executable, it really messed up the first simon thingy.

Closing the things in HTML is important, otherwise entire paragraphs are links (whoops).

In the event that you lose your .pem file you do in fact have to start a new instance. 

Important for centering things: justify-content: space-around;

In order to get the styling I want, I end up using a mix of regular CSS and Bootstrap.

Also there are several ways to do CSS, the two main being internal (in the HTML) and external (a .css file)
